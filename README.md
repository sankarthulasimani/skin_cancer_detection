# Prediction Of skin cancer
> CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

#### Buisness Goal

The Following diseases are predicted accurately which can help in timely diagnosis,
* Actinic keratosis
* Basal cell carcinoma
* Dermatofibroma
* Melanoma
* Nevus
* Pigmented benign keratosis
* Seborrheic keratosis
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
The model 3 was able predict skin cancer of all 9 classes with an accuracy metrics of,
